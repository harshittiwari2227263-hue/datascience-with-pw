    "                                    Assignment Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "ANS-Interpreted languages are executed line by line, while compiled languages are translated into machine code before execution. Interpreted languages offer more flexibility and ease of debugging, while compiled languages generally provide better performance and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "ANS-Exception Handling in python is a mechanism that allows you to handle runtime errors gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "ANS-The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
    "ANS-keep track of the events that happen when some software runs, we use logging module to log the msgs in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "ANS-The __del__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to define cleanup actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "ANS-The import statement is used to import an entire module, while from ... import is used to import specific attributes or functions from a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "ANS-You can handle multiple exceptions in Python by using multiple except blocks or by specifying a tuple of exceptions in a single except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "ANS-The with statement is used to create a context in which a file is opened. It ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "ANS-Multithreading involves multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space, while multiprocessing involves multiple processes, each with its own memory space. Multiprocessing can take advantage of multiple CPU cores, while multithreading is more lightweight and can be more efficient for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "ANS-Logging provides a way to track events that happen during the execution of a program, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "ANS-Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and deallocating memory for objects in a program. Python uses a combination of reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "ANS-The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python are:\n",
    "1. Identify the code that may raise an exception and wrap it in a try block.\n",
    "2. Use one or more except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions.\n",
    "3. Optionally, use a finally block to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    " 13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "ANS- Memory management is important in Python to ensure efficient use of system resources, prevent memory leaks, and optimize performance. Proper memory management helps maintain the stability and responsiveness of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "ANS-The try block is used to wrap code that may raise an exception, while the except block is used to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "ANS-Python's garbage collection system works by using reference counting to keep track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is automatically deallocated. Additionally, Python has a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up reference cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "ANS-The else block is used to define a block of code that will be executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "ANS-The common logging levels in Python are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "ANS-os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current process, while the multiprocessing module provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing multiple processes. The multiprocessing module is more portable and easier to use across different operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
    "ANS-Closing a file in Python is important to free up system resources, ensure that all data is properly written to the file, and prevent data corruption. It is good practice to close files when they are no longer needed, and using the with statement helps automate this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
    "ANS-file.read() reads the entire contents of a file at once, while file.readline() reads a single line from the file at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
    "ANS-The logging module in Python is used for tracking events that happen during program execution. It provides a way to log messages at different severity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
    "ANS-The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system and perform file handling operations such as creating, deleting, and manipulating files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "ANS-Some challenges include dealing with circular references, managing memory for large objects, and optimizing memory usage in long-running applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
    "NAS-You can raise an exception manually in Python using the raise statement, followed by the exception type and an optional error message. For example:\n",
    "raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "\n",
    "25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "ANS -Multithreading is important in certain applications to improve performance by allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently, making better use of system resources, and enhancing the responsiveness of applications, especially those that involve I/O operations or require parallel processing"
